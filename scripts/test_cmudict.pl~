# do a sanity check on a dictionary (# of tabs, duplicates)
# this should be done after manual editing and before checking in
#
# [21oct98] (air) Created
# [30oct98] (air) expanded functionality: check for phonetic symbols
# [03feb99] (air) bug fix; added noise symbols to check
# [20010623] (air) added cmd-line flags; word/pron bound now \s+
# [20080422] (air) fixed for DOS eol's, also noisefile now properly optional
# [20090331] (air) *** RENAMED to test_cmudict.pl ***
#                  added tests specific to the raw cmudict

#
# correct dictionary format is:   ^WORD(\(\d\))*\tW ER\d* DD\n$
# 
# - "W ER DD" are symbols from the legal phone set(s)
# - no leading/trailing spaces allowed
# - no duplicates words allowed
# - character collating sequence enforced for baseform
# 
# above spec should cover all (current) consumers of the dictionary file.
# not all conventions checked however (eg, for multiple pronunciations)
#
