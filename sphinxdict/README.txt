Converted versions of cmudict; suitable as input to trainer and decoder
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[20080219] (air)
[20100118] (air)  updated; reflects new organization

The Sphinx-compatible version of the dictionary, compiled from the 
corresponding version of cmudict. For human browsing, please use the 
uncompiled version.

To produce a new version of the SPHINX dictionary see instructions in
../scripts/README

Note that compilation produces two (identical) files. The generic
cmudict_SPHINX_40 is for convenience: the name is not expected to
change as the dictionary evolves. It is (reasonably) safe to use it in
your programs and scripts.
