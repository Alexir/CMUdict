cmudict Change Log and Notes
-------------

Additional Notes
----------------
scripts/make_baseform.pl
Takes a base cmudict and transforms it into Sphinx-compatible format.

scripts/test_dict.pl
Checks a Sphinx format dictionary for correctness (since Sphinx is
picky about format). This should not be necessary unless you manually
modify the Sphinx dictionary. You can use it to check a .handdict file
for errors (see Logios).


ToDo
----
1. a version of test_dict for the base dictionary.
2. consider moving from a flat file to an xml format such as PLS.
3. consider elininating predictable inflected forms (such as -S -'S
   -ED) to reduce the size of the dictionary.

cmudict.0.6d was the last publicly released version of the
dictionary. It was used in the lmtool service until 2008.

cmudict.0.7 was an extension of the 6d version and represented an
additional year or so of development work, however it was never
publicly released. At some point it removed from distribution by the
then maintainer.

cmudict.0.7a and cmudict.0.6e are modifed versions of the above
dictionaries. 0.6e updates 0.6d with new words found in 0.7 as well as
any corrections to 0.6d entries. It should be considered a transitional
version of cmudict, or perhaps as a corrected version of 0.7.

0.7a reflects corrections to systematic errors as well as the addition
of new words.

The modifications are as follows:

1) Entries appearing in both 0.6d and 0.7 that had different
pronunciations were examined and the appropriate version inserted in
both dictionaries. Notionally this meant taking a corrected entry
from 0.7 and putting it into 0.6d.

2) 0.7 was examined for variant errors. Specifically, words that had >6
variants had improbable variants removed. (This should eventually be redone
using a lower threshold, say a maximum of 3 per entry).

3) Geminate consonants, typically appearing in compound words, were
collapsed.

4) Certain systematic pronunciation (actually LTS rule) errors were
corrected. (Specifically McXxxx and O'Xxxxx forms.)

5) Serendipitously discovered errors (encountered in the course of the
above clean-ups) were corrected.

6) Proper names in the top 10k found in the 1990 US Census and not already
in these dictionaries were added.

[For modifications 2-6, all changes were propagated to 0.6d.]
??? not sure what this means anymore

Version 0.4

cmudict.0.1.Z is the first one we put out. cmudict.0.4.Z is the latest
and most up-to-date) containing approximately 100k words and their
transcriptions; lists of the words are in cmulex.0.[134].Z. We use
these dictionaries at Carnegie Mellon in our speech understanding
systems.

The phone set for cmudict.0.4 contains 39 phones, a list of which can be
found in phoneset.0.4.

Lexical stress is indicated by means of a numeral [012] attached to a vowel:
  0 = no stress
  1 = primary stress
  2 = secondary stress

Alternate transcriptions are identified with a numeral in parentheses as
part of the lexical entry.

We generated this dictionary using the following independent sources:
- a 20k+ general English dictionary, built by hand at Carnegie Mellon
  (extensively proofed and used).
- a 200k+ UCLA-proofed version of the shoup dictionary.
- a 32k subset of the Dragon dictionary.
- a 53k+ dictionary of proper names, synthesiser-generated, unproofed.
- a 200k dictionary generated with Orator, unproofed.
- a 200k dictionary generated with Mitalk, unproofed.

All entries that occur solely in copyrighted sources, like the Dragon
dictionary, are not currently included in this dictionary. If you have
words and transcriptions that you would like included in this unrestricted
resource, please send them to Robert L. Weide (weide@cs.cmu.edu) and we
will consider them for an upcoming version.

All of the above sources were preprocessed and the transcriptions in the
current cmudict.0.1 were selected from the transcriptions in the sources or
a combination thereof. We have removed some potentially unreliable
transcriptions from this dictionary, including those based on only one
source, and will reintroduce them once we have verified the transcriptions.
