## CMUdict
Various maintenance and development scripts for managing the cmudict
* recently updated dictionaries
* scripts for manipulation
* schemes for maintenance workflows

Note: This is a working version of cmudict, maintained by Alexander
Rudnicky (`air@cm.cmu.edu`) for mainly his own use..  It is not
necessarly up-to-date; other versions exist and might be more up-to-date.  This version is periodically updated by Alex Rudnicky, at which
time other changes from other versions may be incorporated. Yes, I
know, this should really be a branch. But it's not. 


In particular, take a look at  `https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict`.
