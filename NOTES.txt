[20150103] 
- added duplicate test to test_cmudict.pl

- The version control situation is not completely in-hand: discovered
  an earlier version of the update that's not in tune with the current
  branch. Need to fix.

-- pull out acronyms for purposes of g2p training
 - script a branching to filter out / re-introduce acronyms

-- work on AH0/IH0 problem
 - collapse all variants of this type

[20150109]
- various cleanups; mostly stress but also other items
- g2p improves by ~0.1; at least it's in the right direction...

[20150110]
- finished builing an 'acronym' set, of ~470 entries
- wrote script to filter acronyms from dict, makes "clean" training set
- set up training with this set; expect better model (?)
